# Graph Theory in Python

This project explores fundamental graph theory concepts and algorithms using Python.  
It is designed as a learning project to practice data structures, algorithms, and visualization.

## Features
- Graph representation (adjacency list / adjacency matrix)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
- Graph visualization with `networkx` and `matplotlib`

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Victorg18/graph-theory-py.git
cd graph-theory-py
pip install -r requirements.txt
